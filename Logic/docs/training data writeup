1. Data Pipeline ArchitectureThe system follows a "Synthetic Supervised Learning" model. Instead of hand-labeling thousands of real images, we programmatically generate the "Ground Truth" (the text) and the "Input" (the image) simultaneously.The Logical Flow:Source Material: The strips.txt file acts as the "brain." Every line represents a unique concept the AI must learn to read.Permutation Engine: The script takes 1 line of text and multiplies it by:$N$ Fonts (Serif, Sans, Monospace, etc.)$R$ Rotations (0°, 15°, 90°, etc.)Randomized Scale (12pt to 48pt)Augmentation: Noise (Blur and Jitter) is applied to ensure the model doesn't become "lazy" by only seeing perfect pixels.2. Folder StructureThe output is organized for high-speed ingestion by machine learning frameworks (like TensorFlow or PyTorch)./Data/: The root directory./fonts/: Contains the .ttf files used to "skin" the text./lists/: Contains list-of-fonts.txt and strips.txt./document training data/:/data/: Contains the .png files. Names are padded with zeros (e.g., 00000001.png) to maintain alphabetical sorting./directory/: Contains dataset_manifest.jsonl. This is the "dictionary" that tells the trainer which image contains which text.3. The Manifest Structure (JSONL)The dataset_manifest.jsonl (JSON Lines) format is used because it allows the training script to read one line at a time without loading the entire file into RAM.Example Entry:JSON{"id": "00000581", "text": "!! Warning !!", "font_size": 45, "rotation": 0, "width": 248, "height": 51}
id: Links directly to the filename.text: The "Label" or "Ground Truth." This is what the AI is trying to guess.font_size / rotation: Metadata that can be used later to analyze which styles the AI struggles with most.4. Synthesizing "Reality" (Augmentation)To make the AI robust, the script applies several transformations to the text:Geometric VariationJitter: The text is shifted slightly ($\pm 2$ pixels). This prevents the AI from over-fitting to a specific "perfect" center point.Rotation: By rotating the text, the AI learns the shapes of characters rather than just their vertical orientation.Optical DistortionGaussian Blur: 30% of images are blurred. This forces the neural network to look at "global features" (the general shape of a 'W') rather than "local features" (sharp edges), which is vital for reading low-quality scans.5. Training Strategy (The train.py Logic)The training script uses the data to build a CNN-RNN (Convolutional Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network) or a simple Dense Classifier.Normalization: Every image is converted to grayscale and resized to a fixed height (e.g., 64 pixels).Character Mapping: The script creates a "Vocabulary" of every symbol found in strips.txt.Backpropagation: The model looks at 00000581.png, guesses the text, compares it to the label !! Warning !!, and uses the difference (the "Loss") to update its neurons.6. Scaling the DatasetThe total size of your dataset is calculated as:$$\text{Total Images} = \text{Lines in strips.txt} \times \text{Active Fonts} \times \text{Rotations}$$With your current setup:500 lines $\times$ 10 fonts $\times$ 1 (no rotation) = 5,000 images.500 lines $\times$ 10 fonts $\times$ 24 (15° increments) = 120,000 images.Would you like me to create a "Validation Script" that you can run after generating the data to ensure no images are corrupted and every JSONL entry has a matching file?
